A parser for english written in c++ using boost and opencv. I'm using opencv to draw the "UI" but really, it's supposed to be just for debugging. I'm using boost because i didn't want to spend time writing my own string.split, but considering the time i've already put in that would be a non-stupid way to spend my time.

Yeah they're all in the base folder i'll change that eventually.
Notes.txt includes all my planned 'features' for this, but i really only think one step ahead.

A parser for english written in c++ using boost and opencv. I'm using opencv to draw the "UI" but really, it's supposed to be just for debugging. I'm using boost because i didn't want to spend time writing my own string.split, but considering the time i've already put in that would be a non-stupid way to spend my time.

Yeah it's all in one ugly file, just like the production rules, but whatever, i'll change it eventually.
Notes.txt includes all my planned 'features' for this, but i really only think one step ahead.
